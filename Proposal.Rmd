  An abstract is a self-contained, short, and powerful statement that describes a larger work. Components vary according to discipline. An abstract of a social science or scientific work may contain the scope, purpose, results, and contents of the work. An abstract of a humanities work may contain the thesis, background, and conclusion of the larger work. An abstract is not a review, nor does it evaluate the work being abstracted.  s

# what we need to do:
Description of data and preliminary data preparation:
Source of data: Freddie Mac, The Federal Home Loan Mortage Corp. (FHLMC). A government sponsored corporation that buys mortages and packages them into mortage-backed securities. (How they collect the data?) (What is the data about?)


Description of major attributes (variables): 

### Monthly Performance Dataset<br/>
||Variable Name|Description|Type|

|1     |Loan Sequence Number|Unique identifier assigned to each loan. |Categorical|
|2     |Monthly reporting period|The as-of month for loan information contained in the loan record. |Date|
|3     |Current Actual UPB|The Current Actual UPB reflects the mortgage ending balance as reported by the servicer for the corresponding monthly reporting period.  |Numeric|
|4     |Current Loan Delinquency Status |A value corresponding to the number of days the borrower is delinquent, based on the due date of last paid installment (“DDLPI”) reported by servicers to Freddie Mac, and is calculated under the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) method.  |Categorical|

|6     |Remaining months to legal maturity|Unique identifier assigned to each loan. |categorical|
|7     |Repurchase flag|Indicates loans that have been repurchased or made whole (not inclusive of pool-level repurchase settlements).  |categorical|
|8     |Modification Flag|For mortgages with loan modifications, indicates that the loan has been modified.  |Categorical|
|9     |Zero Balance Code|A code indicating the reason the loan's balance was reduced to zero. |Categorical|
|10    |Zero Balance Effective Date|The date on which the event triggering the Zero Balance Code took place. |Date|

Total of 26 variables in the original data set. And a total of 24 variables in the monthly data set. 
(What are the variables exactly, categorical or numerical?)
(What are the variables about?)

Quality of the data: 
- Many empty or N/A values in the monthly performance data set.<br/>
The Dataset is sparse in nature. 15 out of 23 total columns are mostly empty or not avalible. Some columns such as Repurchase Flag, Modification Flag, Zero Balance Code, and Zero Balance Effective Data are left empty on purpose, as These data are only avalible in the loan termination months. Also columns like Legal Costs, Tax and Insurance, Miscellaneous Expenses are left empty as the data are only applicable when loan ends with foreclosure or REO Disposition. However other columns such as Actual Loss Calculation are left empty without expanation. Due to the lack of data, there will be certain limitations in future analysis. 

  
  

- Some of the values are coded in a way that we will not know about the exact value of the variable. (Eg: Credit score--below 301:space, above 850:space), poses problems. Some of the variables are unknown too.

## Description


### Source of Data

The dataset utilised in this project is provided by The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC), also known as Freddie Mac. Freddie Mac is a government-sponsored private corporation which aims at providing liquidity, stability and affordability to the U.S. housing market by purchasing residential mortgage loans from the lenders on the secondary mortgage market and consequently sell them to other investors on the market. By doing this, Freddie Mac maintains a stable money flow to the mortgage loan lenders on the market in pursuits of easier homeownership and rental housing for the U.S. citizens.

The liability of the dataset can be guaranteed as Freddie Mac is regulated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), an independent federal agency with expanded legal and regulatory authority and power of several departments of the U.S. Federal Government, such as the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) etc. Regardless of the trustworthiness of the dataset, incompleteness and errors are expected.

### Method of data collection

In hopes of increasing transparency, Freddie Mac has disclosed monthly loan-level credit performance data on a portion of fully amortising fixed-rate mortgages that the company purchased or guaranteed from 1999 to 2017, which could be viewed and downloaded freely on their official website.

### Background information of the data

The Single Family Loan-Level Dataset (the dataset) originally covers approximately 26 million fixed-rate mortgages. Albeit the huge data size, our group will focus on the data between 2007 to 2016 due to limited hardware power of the machines such as memory and storage.

The dataset has two parts: loan origination data and monthly performance data. In the case where the loan is in the origination part but not the performance part, the loan was paid off before the first cycle begins or in the month of origination. The variables in the dataset will be discussed in later sessions.

### Quality of the data
Many of the variables in the data are coded in ways that may not be optimal for analysis. We therefore plan to recode many of the variable into forms that are easier to handle. Below we propose a scheme for such data manipulations


## Preparation
Preparation. What changes? Recoding i.e. mutate, filter, remove NA etc.
