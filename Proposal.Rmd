  An abstract is a self-contained, short, and powerful statement that describes a larger work. Components vary according to discipline. An abstract of a social science or scientific work may contain the scope, purpose, results, and contents of the work. An abstract of a humanities work may contain the thesis, background, and conclusion of the larger work. An abstract is not a review, nor does it evaluate the work being abstracted.  s

# what we need to do:
Description of data and preliminary data preparation:
Source of data: Freddie Mac, The Federal Home Loan Mortage Corp. (FHLMC). A government sponsored corporation that buys mortages and packages them into mortage-backed securities. (How they collect the data?) (What is the data about?)


Description of major attributes (variables):

Total of 26 variables in the original data set. And a total of 24 variables in the monthly data set. 
(What are the variables exactly, categorical or numerical?)
(What are the variables about?)

Quality of the data: 
- Many empty or N/A values in the monthly performance data set.<br/>
The Dataset is sparse in nature. 15 out of 23 total columns are mostly empty or not avalible. Some columns such as Repurchase Flag, Modification Flag, Zero Balance Code, and Zero Balance Effective Data are left empty on purpose, as These data are only avalible in the loan termination months. Also columns like Legal Costs, Tax and Insurance, Miscellaneous Expenses are left empty as the data are only applicable when loan ends with foreclosure or REO Disposition. However some columns such as Actual Loss Calculation are left empty without expanation. Due to the lack of data, there will be certain limitations in future analysis. 

  
  

- Some of the values are coded in a way that we will not know about the exact value of the variable. (Eg: Credit score--below 301:space, above 850:space), poses problems. Some of the variables are unknown too.
